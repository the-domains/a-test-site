<p>A Tale of Two Books: The Debut of Greyweathers Press</p><p>By Larry Thompson</p><p>Early in 2005, after having produced only a few experimental pamplets, I began to set type on a book treatment of <i>Kubla Khan</i>, the seminal poem by one of the Romantic era’s literary titans, Samuel Taylor Coleridge. It would become the first book from Greyweathers Press…. eventually. About the same time, I formalized a contract with a talented young poet to print a small collection of her work titled <i>Tenebrismo</i>, later that same year.</p><p>Ah, the naiveté! In the end, Kubla Khan would take nearly two years to complete, and the talented (and patient) young poet would have to wait another full year more before seeing Tenebrismo finished. As I type, it launched at last on July 14, 2007.</p><p>The printing of these two books tells a tale of frustration and despair, of harrowed ideals, of dogged determination to reach the end (and damn the consequences!), of ultimate completion, and perhaps even success. It describes the trajectory of a letterpress printer new to the craft riding a rather dramatically inclined learning curve. No roller coaster ride could have been more exciting. Or more terrifying.</p><p>Why Kubla Khan? Well, as great works go, it had the marvelous virtue of being short. I did not want to move into my first book taking on a bible, and 54 lines fit the bill. However, there was the poet’s preface, and it seemed appropriate to pen a few words of my own at the beginning to give the reader some idea as to why I was printing this poem. The straight answer is that I loved it, and always have. I’m well aware that some critics of English literature dismiss it as ‘popular’ and therefore unworthy, but that’s simply nonsense. Lord Byron liked it, millions of people since have liked it, and so do I. Coleridge thought it might be a part of a larger piece, so it’s a fragment and, in that sense, imperfect. Incomplete. I liked the idea of having that kind of imperfection in the first book, which I knew, being my first effort, would likely have its fair share of imperfection.</p><p>I acquired my Vandercook 219AB in 2002, and spent the next two years repairing my press, gathering peripheral equipment and type, and reading everything I could find on printing. During that time, I conceived of Kubla Khan as a large book, perhaps even 8” x 14” text block.</p><p>Initially I had set my sights on letterpress with a view to working with type alone, but after seeing the work of some of the great fine press printers both past and present, I decided that the text must include illustrations. I prepared several linoleum cuts suitable for the larger version. Early in 2005, I abandoned the large version of Kubla; it was too ambitious and requiring more type than I possessed. It meant starting from scratch, but the exercise proved useful in that it forced me to consider more carefully several design issues, including binding and the placement of illustrations. As well, being forced to cut my illustrations again resulted in more satisfactory results.</p><p>About this time, I settled on Italian Oldstyle as my house font, and purchased a fair quantity of it. Oddly enough, the font seemed shy on lower case h’s, which did cause some problems at the typesetting stage. Fortunately, decreasing the size of the book to about half at 4.75” x 7.5” (book block) meant that I was able to spread the type further by printing fewer pages at any given time during the run. I worked with mock-ups, a pagination dummy and a template of the 4-up sheet with the text block cut out, so that I could lay it directly over the form on the press bed and see immediately if any of the pages were out of true.</p><picture>

<p>I chose to print on commercial paper. I considered then (as I still do) both Kubla Khan and Tenebrismo to be apprentice works, and therefore I was reluctant to invest many hundreds of dollars into beautiful paper that could wind up in the recycler. So I acquired a rather nice commercial paper called Williamsburg Offset from a local printing house. It was acid free, heavy enough to hold the ink well and had a pleasant tooth. Sure enough, I had to reprint sections of both books, so in the end I feel justified in my choice, although now I am confident future projects will be on finer paper.</p><p>Since Kubla Khan was the first book off the press, I wrote a very short ‘Printer’s Preface’ and chose to set it in a different type – Canterbury – to distinguish it from Coleridge’s words. That, and I didn’t have enough type to set both pieces in the manner that I had the book laid out. The result is a bit peculiar, since I imagine a san serif type like Canterbury is not, I imagine, frequently used in chapter and verse. My plea is that I used what I had at hand.</p><p>After doing several pages, including the colophon which will forever carry the publication date of 2005, life intervened in the form of a tsunami of work – that work which supplies my livelihood. Many times I despaired for my project, and my press in general. Often I would find myself late at night in the studio, bone weary and exhausted, pathetically rolling the press head up and down the bed before retiring dejectedly to bed. This period challenged my reasons for having my own press. Without time to work on projects, what was the point? I had spent the last couple of years talking to family and friends about letterpress printing, and I imagine that they began to wonder what kind of folly I was up to. It was also during this time that I joined a studio tour and helped form an artists’ cooperative storefront. I needed a body of work immediately, so I shelved Kubla Khan and went to work producing a number of linocut illustrations and a couple of broadsheets. The interruptions lasted nearly a year, and I did not return in earnest to the book until the early spring of 2006.</p><picture>

<p>After general printing was finished, I discovered a typographical error. Once I had put behind me thoughts of suicide, of destroying the entire edition or of crawling off somewhere with a case of Jack Daniels, I set about the work of reprinting the pages – front and back – of the sheet with the typo.</p><p>The most frightening moment of the entire endeavor involved the guillotine. Not that I feared the razor-sharp blade; I’m very careful with tools and equipment. No, the fear came from the notion that I could destroy months of work with a single stroke of the cutter. I measuring five times, cut once and the sheets were ready for folding, collating and binding.</p><p>And what about binding? After abandoning the large-format Kubla Khan, I had not revisited the question of binding. In the end, I pillaged our studio’s store of Saint-Armand cover weight paper of various colours, and some Saint-Armand white canal paper. Some of these white covers were painted rich greens and blues, then sprinkled with gold and copper powders. Others were left white, and Holly painted a decorative red swash across the lower portion of the cover with a ruling pen. A simple side-stitch bound the end pages and text block to the cover.</p><p>We launched Kubla Khan in July of 2006, after which I launched back into other labours, and did not return to printing until early in 2007. However, during that time I had the chance to meet frequently with Kera Willis, the author of Tenebrismo and more carefully plan the book. Armed with more thoughtful consideration, the beginning of work on Tenebrismo resembled in my mind more a set-piece military assault than any kind of creative endeavor. Determined to avoid the constant interruptions and delays that plagued Kubla Khan and, I believe, impaired its quality, I blocked off an entire month dedicated to printing, set up a schedule to keep me on target, and tracked my hours. Working morning, noon and evening for the entire month of May, I nearly finished all work, then lost my momentum when forced to return to other responsibilities.</p><p>My goals with Tenebrismo were straightforward enough: hold the line on more generous margins to let the poems breath, and improve the consistency of the impression. In some cases the lines do not scan across the entire text block. That, combined with the off-centre configuration of the classical page lay-out, creates some imbalance on some spreads. As for impression, working in a concentrated times space and prior experience created an improved impression throughout, although it is clear that I still have much work ahead of me before I achieve that perfect impression. For me, the chore of finding the perfect balance of ink and impression seems equivalent to discovering the Philosopher’s Stone.</p><p>Over all, production on Tenebrismo went more smoothly than Kubla. And like Kubla, I waited until well into production to settle the illustrations, which again made me feel akin to a reckless river boat gambler. Fortunately I am lucky, because the illustrations, when they arrived proved ideally suited to the subject matter, and fit in good proportion the open spots I left in the text. The converted easily to the linoleum, cut quickly and printed easily, with one frustrating exception. Two of the blocks began to deteriorate during their print runs, but held together well enough to . Yet another argument in favour of making the move to wood cutting and wood engraving sooner than later.</p><p>Between finishing the text and printing the illustrations, a typo revealed its flawed face in the book’s opening poem. And just like in Kubla, I spent too much energy in angst and indecision before finally resetting the type, reprinting the spread and settling the matter. Part of the angst had its root in simple exhaustion. In the future when faced with a typographical error during the production, I have vowed not to fuss and fret, but just get to work fixing it. If the error should be pointed out at the book’s launch, well, then it will be time to start drinking out of the wine bottle. In the end, I’ve learned, typo’s happen. Deal with it.</p><p>While printing the illustrations, two of the lino block began to deteriorate during printing. In the end, I decide to push on and make repairs to the prints by hand rather than reprint entire sections.</p><p>The binding of Tenebrismo followed the same trajectory as Kubla Khan, with a simple side stitch in black cover card weight stock, with the title device printed in black ink and cut-outs revealing the only colour in book: colour laser printed end pages of Europe and North Africa copied from an old atlas. At the last moment, I decided to do a deluxe edition, and had copies one through fifteen bound in leather out-of-studio.</p><p>The first and most important thing that I have learned from printing Kubla Khan and Tenebrismo is that I want to print more books. So with that in mind, I move into the future with several goals in mind. One: plan the job carefully before beginning. Two: if possible, execute the work in a concentrated period of time. If this is not possible, break the schedule into rational steps, do one thing at a time and do it with care and thought. I have a dangerous tendency to set myself on automatic; I ask you, what is the point of printing by hand if the brain is set on automatic? Three: learn to love the process. I’m setting type for books by hand and printing by hand for many very good reasons. It’s my choice so I should learn to love it and stop grumbling to myself during production. I can’t remember where I read it, but the phrase “kiss the chains that bind you” resonates with me. Four: don’t waste time and worry over typos – just fix them. Five: I must accept my own fallibility and the imperfections of the books I make. I’ll work to raise the bar on quality in my work, but I must not let the chance of failure or error make me stop printing.</p><picture>
